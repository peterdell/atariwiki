title: Voice and Data Cassettes
---
The goal of this chapter is to provide the user with information regarding the capabilities of Atari to mix Voice & Data on Cassettes.  
Below are given some examples of how Atari has done this.  
If you intend to record cassettes from Atari, please use the __wav-format, 16-bit stereo and 44.1 kHz__. With those parameters we do have the best experiences.  
Files in wav-format are very big in size and therefore not very cool for download. We prefer the FLAC-format, see [FLAC - download](https://www.xiph.org/flac/download.html).  
It is possible to convert the wav-files without (!) any loss to ".flac" files (around 50 % less compare to ".wav" files) when opening in a shell. And back to ".wav" files of course. Please see the example below for further info.  
On Mac OS X you can use the "Terminal" application and for a ".wav" file called "A.wav" use the following commands:  
- encoding: flac -8 /Volumes/"your harddrive"/A.wav  
- decoding: flac -d /Volumes/"your harddrive"/A.flac  
  
A web based solution can be found here: [audio.online-convert](http://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-flac) ; Thank you very much Fred for that golden tip. :-)
