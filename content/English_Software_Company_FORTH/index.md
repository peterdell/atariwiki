# English Software Company FORTH  
  
Seems to be based an FIG-FORTH, but with some unique "Words". Requires an Atari 400/800 OS (non-XL) or Oldrunner Disk. In The Netherlands EsForth was released by Aackosoft, who distributed many titles from English Software. This cassette version runs also on XL/XE models.
