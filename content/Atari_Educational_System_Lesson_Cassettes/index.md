## Complete list of the Atari Educational System Lesson Cassettes: 16 courses were made, each one has 4 cassettes! Auto Mechanics CX6013 was announced, but not published. Thanks to Michael Current, Kay Savetz and Thomas Cherryhomes, we can offer a solution for this, please see below. General hint: If you discover problems with reading of the files, please reset the Atari and leave the position of the cassette reader unchanged. Try again, until you hear a high frequency sound or discover it works. In Altirra F2-key for START and F5-key for RESET.

Lloyd G. Dorsett, the founder, has proven, that the Atari can do much more than just playing games. He was so much ahead of his time. Indeed, with his work, we face the 1st generation of e-learning with over 1,000 (!) programs. He made 64 courses with 8 hours duration. Atari just released 16 courses, but had an option for much more! If someone has the source code of the cartridge and can provide it to us, so we can see, how the data was read in from the cassettes, we would be very, very lucky. :-) Further, if someone has the missing 48 courses or even just informations about them, we would be very happy, too. Please see an advertisement from Popular Science, January 1983, page 99 (thank you so much tschak909 from AtariAge for giving us the information):

## Outlook:  
So you think you now have the complete Atari Educational System program? Think again:  
  
![](attachments/45packages.jpg)  
The 'remaining' ones from the Dorsett Educational System program for the Atari. The NeverEnding Story is a fantasy film, but The NeverEnding: "Thank you Kay Savetz" is for real! Kay, if there is an Atari walk of fame, be sure, you deserve a star under the top 10 there!
