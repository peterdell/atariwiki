# Thanks  
  
  
Please take into account that this site is still in the making. So, if your name is not listed here, that doesn't mean, we have forgotten you, it just means, we still haven't found the time to insert you here. Therefore, we apologize in advance for any inconvenience concerning this.  
  
Further, we would like to ask you for the final name of this site: thanks, credits, hall of fame, walk of fame, site of fame etc. to suggest a few.  
  
Many people have contributed over time to the AtariWiki. In this page, we want to thank special contributors for their work preserving Atari and 6502 Programming information.  
  
## Bill Wilkinson  
  
If you don't know Bill Wilkinson, you don't know anything of Atari and OSS, not even a single bit!

Thank you so much Bill for your life achievement, your family and the Atari community will miss you. You belong to those, who are not replaceable, we are deeply in your obligation. You and your work will last forever in our consciousness and our hearts, too. We will continue your spirit, wherever you may be now. Thank you.  
  
## Curtis T. 'Curt' Vendel (1966-2020)  
  
Curt Vendel was a former Atari employee(?) and provides us with extreme rare information, files etc., who are essential for the restoration of Atari's past. Curt took personal risks to save as much original Atari hardware as possible. He saved the Atari Accountant for us, an incredible amount of source code files (still to come), Silent Butler 80 and so many ultra rare hardware, software and information, the community would be much, much poorer now without it!

## Uwe Röder  
  
In 1989 Uwe Röder wrote [Hypra-Soft-Basic](../Hypra-Soft-Basic/index.md), which was and still is the one and only Basic for Atari making reliable and mathematical correct calculations. All math floating point routines were rewritten and are the best possible condition. In 2015 Uwe Röder has given us the rights to his Basic.

## Kay Savetz  
  
Without Kay many things of the now Atari community would be simply even unthinkable! Whether there is a mission impossible concerning Atari, Kay Savetz is our "Jim Phelbs" for these very missions. Kay has done so much for the community, he really deserves a star on the Atari walk of fame. His recent addition was the impossible to find PILOT II language. So much has to be added here, please check in from time to time to continue on this. Kay runs a podcast: http://ataripodcast.libsyn.com/rss which is highly recommended, because all the stars from the golden age are interviewed there. Further, Kay runs his own website: http://www.atariarchives.org/ which is highly recommended, too.

## Allan Bushman  
  
Allan plays a major role in preserving many Atari programs, especially those, which seem to be lost. Without him the restoration of the Atari Program Exchange (APX) would not be possible. Allan has further access to programs which are not even on the far end of the rarity list! Without his contributions the Atari community would be significantly poorer and many problems couldn't been solved. Allan please go ahead, we deeply need you.

## Roland B. Wassenberg  
  
Roland is one of the main contributors to this wiki, he is tireless chasing for lost items, the 'Indiana Jones' of Atari history. Roland was essential in bringing back the Atari Calculator, parts of Action!, BUG/65 and many Atari application programs. Further, the 'Atari Educational System' program with big contributions from Allan Bushman and the complete 'Voice & Data Cassette' language program, which were never be possible without the contributions from Stefan Meyer and Peter Dell. He plays a major role in getting Atari source codes.  
  
''Thank you Roland!''  
  
## all the hardware people, without them, nothing would run anymore!
