# Atari Calculator CX8102  
  
The Atari Calculator is an advanced non-programmable as well as programmable calculator that supports RPN, ALG and ALGN calculation modes. Calculator goes far beyond the limits of Atari Basicâ€™s mathematical capabilities, precision and has no bugs.  
Calculator has 100 memory registers, additionally a 42 number stack and is fully programmable up to 3072 bytes. Programs and memory registers can each be stored separately on disk or tape. It was the 'Mathematica', 'Maple', Mathcad' etc. of its time.  
  
## FEATURES OF THE ATARI CALCULATOR:  
  
- Built in 145 functions often used in science and finance  
- The ability of hardcopy output using any of the ATARI printers  
- The ability to save and load numerical data from disk or tape  
- You can define whether to use standard input or RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). RPN is generally preferred in scientific work  
- Easy conversion between Imperial/Metric systems: (Fahrenheit-Celsius, Degrees-Radians, Polar-Rectangular, etc.)  
- Memory with displayable stack (you can see what's in memory)  
- You have the ability to fix the amount of digits displayed to 8 places and also exponentiation  
- The capability to easily enter numbers in Decimal, Octal, or Hex.  
- The standard math functions of Pi, square root, rounding off, reciprocals, etc.  
- Fundamental functions (absolute value function, fraction function, integer function, truncate function, etc.)  
- Algebraic and trigonometric functions, statistics functions, financial functions, bit manipulation functions, etc.  
- Algebraic functions including factorials, modulos, logarithm's  
- Sine, Cosine, Tangent functions, and the Arc's of each  
- Statistical functions with slope, mean functions, standard deviation, and much more including linear regression  
- Financial applications with 14 different functions  
- much more to explore...  
  
The Calculator requires 24K of RAM.

Please do not use MEM.SAV with DOS. Instead use the SAVEM as well as the LOADM command of Calculator to store and load the user memory to other programs and/or devices.

Atari Calculator cartridge: The Atari Calculator was originally scheduled as a cartridge. Because Atari did not manage it to sell this in 1979 and on top needed 2 more years to publish it on diskette in 1981, we decided to honor the author of Calculator, Carol Shaw, with the creation of a cartridge label, which matches best the design of those times. The next free CXL-number was assigned so, but you as the reader know, it should have been a CXL-number with a double zero "00" ;-). The creation of the label, its accuracy, its colors etc. would not have been possible without [Oliver Rapp](http://des-or-mad.net). Oliver, we all thank you so much! Please go ahead with your outstanding work in graphics and design.
