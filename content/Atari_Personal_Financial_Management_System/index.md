Please check [atari8bitads.blogspot.de](http://atari8bitads.blogspot.de/2017/03/a-welcome-addition.html) from Bill Lange, which solves the mystery around the box. Great work Bill! Please go ahead, we really appreciate your help. :-)))

- [System Diskette II (Model CX8114)](attachments/Personal_Finance_Management_System_CX8114.atr)  
- [Blank Diskette (Model CX8100)](attachments/Blank_Diskette_CX8100.atr) ; special blank diskette for P.F.M.S. only.  
- [First Data Diskette](attachments/First_Data_Diskette.atr) ; already formatted in the required P.F.M.S.-Data-Format. Ready to use.  
  
On both System Diskettes copy protection is used. It seems to be Atari DOS II 2.0S(?) type protection. Please take into account, that only DOS I and II were available at the time of creation. Therefore, DOS II duplicate disk would only copy sectors marked as used in the VTOC. P.F.M.S. DOS is a custom DOS II, where the directory and VTOC are different, so normal DOS II won't copy it at all. Users saw this, so they created custom versions of DUP.SYS like Yellow DOS and LJS (Long John Silver) DOS to name a couple.  
  
The goal here would be to get rid of this, create a DD diskette, which holds both system disks on one. So now disk swap isn't necessary any more. Further a DD data diskette, which accesses drive 2 only. The code on the system disks must be changed, when programs on the 2nd system diskette are accessed, as shown in the figure below: 'P.F.M.S. Main Menu with location of the modules on the two system diskettes'.  
  
At that point Mr. Bacardi has already taken over:  
  
- [Personal_Finance_Management_System_CX8113_SD-DOS_2.5.atr](attachments/Personal_Finance_Management_System_CX8113_SD-DOS_2.5.atr) ; a)  
- [Personal_Finance_Management_System_CX8114_MD-DOS_2.5.atr](attachments/Personal_Finance_Management_System_CX8114_MD-DOS_2.5.atr) ; b)  
  
and delivered us a SD image for the CX8113 type and a MD image for the CX8114 type.  
  
Have already started to bring both images on just one DD image:

up to now, PFMS is not running with c). Who can help us?
