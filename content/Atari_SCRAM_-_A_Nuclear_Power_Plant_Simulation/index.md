# Atari SCRAM-A Nuclear Power Plant Simulation CX4123 (Basic) by Chris Crawford  
  
## Please take into account how visionary this program was in 1981(!)  
  
## Here are some visions for further developments:  
### - [A program like: NUKEMAP from Alex Wellerstein](http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/)  
### - [A similar program like the above for zero-point bombs using the Casimir effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect)
