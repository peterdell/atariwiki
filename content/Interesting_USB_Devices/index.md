# Some nice USB Devices for small Computers  
  
## USB VGA Graphic Card

A Japanese company is selling graphics adapters intended for USB 2.0 bus.  
  
Telegnosis; USB 2.0 VGA adapter allows to display 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768 resolutions with 8/16/32-bit color depth, the target market for the product seems to be business-oriented customers who need some additional capabilities from their notebooks or desktops.  
  
It is not clear which graphics processor is used in Telegnosis&#8217; device. Keeping in mind the small size of the adapter, it is likely that the USB 2.0 VGA is powered by a mobile graphics processor with embedded memory.

This seems to be the same product in a different box. It can be found [here](http://www.usb2vga.de/). According to [this site](http://www.winischhofer.at/linuxsisusbvga.shtml) it is built around the SiS315 graphic chip. A Linux driver exists, so why not Atari? ;-)

Certainly some games could be played with it and I believe it can be also put into some practical use.

## USB Flash Stick  
  
Q: What about access to one of the often used USB Flash Storages? <br>  
e.g. the Kingmax USB 2.0 128MB. -- Main.RalfPatschke - 11 Aug 2004  
  
A: USB 2.0 might be to much Software Driver overhead for a small machine, but USB !! might be possible. We're already investigating. As always, help in getting the knowlegde in USB UFI mass storage driver programming is appreciated.
