# Indus GT DD Floppy Drive  
  
### Turn your Atari into a Ferrari  
  
  
By far one of the most popular aftermarket drives for the Atari 8-bit computers was the Indus GT. Sold in a Big black case with psu and manuals, it really was a great looking and even better performing Drive. The styling with the LED readout, and dust cover door, half height profile and all black finish, made it a sexy choice for sure. With an option to install an S-Ram Charger, it literally turned the Floppy drive into a Z80 CP/M computer that you then used your Atari as a terminal to access. A version of CP/M 2.2 was included with the upgrade.[INDUS_CPM_2.2](../INDUS_CPM_2.2/index.md)  
  
A great manual came with the drive, and other manuals were also made available which made this a very popular drive because of its support.
