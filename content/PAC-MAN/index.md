# PAC-MAN Source Code  
  
Sometimes wonders just happen, this can't be more true, than for the source code of PAC-MAN. After a long, long time, this miracle just happend, please see below for more details.  
  
## Source Code  
- [PAC-MAN_Source_Code_2.zip](attachments/PAC-MAN_Source_Code_2.zip) ; this is the source code for the Atari 8-bit PAC-MAN game. This version is adapted to work with the WUDSN IDE with MADS, and modified to be able to compile several versions of PAC MAN. See the [Makefile.bat](attachments/Makefile.bat) file for further details on how to compile your desired version.  
- [PAC-MAN_Source_Code_Macro_Assembler.zip](attachments/PAC-MAN_Source_Code_Macro_Assembler.zip) ; this is the original version from 1982, which was written with Atari Macro Assembler.  
  
## XEX files ; compiled from the source codes  
- [PACMAN-ORIGINAL.xex](attachments/PACMAN-ORIGINAL.xex) ; Atari's original version of PAC-MAN compiled from the source code  
- [PACMAN-ROKLAN.xex](attachments/PACMAN-ROKLAN.xex) ; version from ROKLAN Corp., ran from disk  
- [PACMAN-ATARI82.xex](attachments/PACMAN-ATARI82.xex) ; This version of PAC-MAN has broken intermission scenes 3 and 4, and though the ROM was found online this version was probably not sold. We think was a leaked, pre-release version.  
- The differences between these three versions are primarily small changes in graphics and sound. The Atari82 version also handles joystick control differently.  
- [PACMAN-DATASOFT.xex](attachments/PACMAN-DATASOFT.xex) ; disk version from Datasoft. This version eliminates all references to Atari (such as copyright messages.) The Atari logo fruit bonus has been replaced with a Galaxian flagship. ![](attachments/datasoft-fruit.png)  
  
- [PACMAN-ORIGINAL-INTERMISSION-DEMO.xex](attachments/PACMAN-ORIGINAL-INTERMISSION-DEMO.xex) ; same as PACMAN-ORIGINAL, hacked so that eating one dot ends the level, so the user can see quickly the intermission sequences without doing the hard work, in case there may be less time. ;-) Thank you so much JAC! from AtariAge for making such a pleasure for us. We are deep in your debt. :-)
