The Atari Bond Analysis program contains two different Bond programs, Bond Yield and Bond Price! With the Bond Analysis programs you will be able to calculate the yield to maturity of a bond given the annual coupon, the par value or redemption price at maturity, the current market price, and the length of time until maturity. You can also calculate the price and accrued interest for a bond, given the coupon, par value, time until maturity, and the forecasted yield.

## ATARI STOCK & BOND ANALYSIS - Review by Peter Pappas  
With the recent developments in the computer field, it was only a matter of time before they would become available to the small businessman. ATARI has created a line of programs for their 800 computer system, which more than meet the needs of a businessman who could use a more organized system of investment analysis. ATARI's Investment Analysis Series of programs can be used by the small businessman or firm, to provide them with a personal analysis of current investments and to assist the individual in determining which investments to make in the future. The Bond Analysis and Stock Analysis programs are two facets of this program series.  
  
The Bond Analysis program will allow the business minded investor to 'study and calculate bond investments'. The program provides the individual with a graphic listing of his investments including their net return or loss and cash value, annual coupon in dollars, the redemption value, maturity and yield, and tax yields utilizing normal income and capital gains rates. These programs base their information on the actual bond information which you provide. While the Bond Analysis program provides you with an analysis or projected pattern for bonds, the Stock program performs roughly the same task for your stock portfolio. This program will provide you with a portfolio analysis using statistical measures of return, deviations between stocks, rates of returns of stocks over a given period of time and a projected analysis of your stock's intrinsic value and growth rate. Both of these programs take your information and project it over a period of time, thus providing you with a chance to alter your investment picture before it becomes too late. Aspects of the actual economy do not affect the computer's analysis of either your bond or stock portfolio. Therefore, the careful investor should only use these aids in investment analysis as a part of a total investment analysis package. These programs are not intended to offer the investor advice; their only intention is to provide the investor with an accurate calculation of (a) his net return or loss, cash value, price and accrued interest and the before and after tax yield of a given bond, (b) the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, annual rates of return and the intrinsic value of your stocks. All of the computer's information is based on the investor's stocks and bonds. Extraneous material is not taken into account in this program.  
  
As a final note, it is important that the investor understand exactly the data which these two programs provide. Utilizing the ATARI 800 computer, these programs provide an analysis of either a stock or bond. They do not project the future for your portfolio. They can not tell you whether your stock will split or fall. All these programs do is provide the user with a means through which he can compare different portfolios in a simple and accurate format which will also provide him with certain consequential calculations. Therefore, if you're in need of a means with which you can organize, analyze, and compute certain information for investment and tax purposes, then the ATARI Investment analysis program series should fit all your investment analysis needs.
