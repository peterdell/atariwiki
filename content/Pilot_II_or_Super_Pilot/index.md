### Background  
ATARI Pilot II or Super PILOT was never shipped and unreleased for the general public. It was used in the Atari summer camps for educational purposes and delivered on diskette only. Therefore, we really deeply thank Kay Savetz so much again for his outstanding and excellent help. Kay, we owe you so much, endless thank you for bringing this lost to believed language to the light. You will never be forgotten! :-)))  
  
For the normal Pilot commands please see [Pilot](../Pilot/index.md), here, we would just like to introduce the new commands in Pilot II:
