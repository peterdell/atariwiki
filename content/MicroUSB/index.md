# The MicroUSB Project  
  
This is the central web page for various USB Developments for Microprocessor Systems and Homecomputers.  
  
The goal is to provide a common USB Solution for Homecomputer Systems and Microprocessor Systems. By using identical Hardware components the most time-consuming task, writing of USB drivers, can be accelerated.  
  
This project supports the USB development with Tools, Development Systems and Information on the USB Protocol and Hardware.  
  
Files for the MicroUSB Project can also be downloaded from SourceForge -> [http://sourceforge.net/projects/microusb/files/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/microusb/files/)
