![](attachments/Atari+Pascal.jpg)  
Atari Pascal Version 1.0 (c) 1982 by ATARI  
  
  
Atari Pascal is a program released by Atari in 1982. It was the first version of Pascal available for the Atari 8-bit computers.  
Because it was released through Atari Program Exchange, Atari Pascal was unsupported by Atari. It also required two disk drives. Please take into account that the Atari Program-Text Editor is needed to generate Pascal source files. The program can be found in the Assembler chapter.  
  
CXL4017 Pascal (cartridge, planned, but never released)  
CX8109 Pascal (planned, but never released, because 128 KB RAM and 2 disk drives were needed)  
CX8110 Pascal Database (planned, but never released, because 128 KB RAM and 2 disk drives were needed)  
CX8115 Pascal-Native Code (planned, but never released, because 128 KB RAM and 2 disk drives were needed)  
CX8116 Pascal-Linker (planned, but never released, because 128 KB RAM and 2 disk drives were needed)
