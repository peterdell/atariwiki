### __Still Missing__  
The community with the help of all has made great progress regarding Kyan Pascal. Tom Eckmann, CEO of Kyan Pascal, was so nice to us, by giving Kyan Pascal into PD. To complete Kyan Pascal, we need your help again. The missing list is as follows:  
  
__- Kyan Pascal version 1.2 and 1.3__  
__- Programming Utility Toolkit for Kyan Pascal version 1.x__  
__- Advanced Graphics Toolkit for Kyan Pascal version 1.x__  
__- Kyan Pascal version 2.00 and 2.03__  
__- Code Optimizer Toolkit for Kyan Pascal version 2.x ; includes the source code for the Runtime Library__  
  
Any help of any kind, even just hints or infos to complete the above site is very welcome at any time. We really would appreciate your help. :-)

### Credits  
We deeply, deeply thank Tom Eckmann, CEO of Kyan Software, for giving Kyan Pascal into PD. Tom, be sure, you are in our hearts forever, you will never be forgotten! Thank you so much! Further, we thank WASEO from Germany for initiating this project, establishing contact to Tom and doing so much for this project. We thank Kay Savetz for interviewing Tom and making contact again. We thank the "stay behind task force from Abbuc" for founding some ultra rare (way above 10) parts of this projects. We thank GoodByteXL for scanning all the manuals, preparing them, bringing them into read mode and getting into Kyan Pascal that deep, so we could build this site. We thank Thomas Grasel from RAF for borrowing his Kyan Pascal version, so we could compare it with the other versions. We thank Fred from the [Atari museum in the Netherlands](https://atarimuseum.nl/) for a major, lost to believe contribution in this project.
