# Atari Dos 3  
  
DOS 3 shipped with 1050 disk drives from 1983-1985.  It was created in part to  
take advantage of the 1050's Dual-Density capability, by employing a single-  
sided, enhanced-density 128K 5.25" floppy disk drive format.  Atari called  
this format "dual-density," but the Atari community quickly came to refer to  
this format as "enhanced-density" to better differentiate it from widely  
available 3rd-party truly double density disk drives and supporting versions  
of DOS.  DOS 3 uses a disk format incompatible with DOS 2.0S.  It included a  
utility to convert files from DOS 2.0S to DOS 3, but not back again.  It used  
disk space less efficiently than DOS 2.0S.  For these reasons and others, DOS  
3 was not widely accepted by the Atari community, and like DOS 1 is not  
generally used except for curiosity's sake.  The DOS 3 disk is labeled: Master  
Diskette 3 (DX5052).
