## Very important  
The original program could not handle todays high stock volumes. Therefore, Wade Ripkowski did a deep investigation into the source code, could find out, what has to be changed and offered us a version, which works even toady (please see above). Thank you so much Wade for preserving and adapting the program to the modern times! For further information, please visit Wade's site:
