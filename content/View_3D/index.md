Magnify shrink rotate, and otherwise shift your view of the 3-D picture easily and fairly quickly Re-quires ACTION! cartridge, disk drive and 48K memory Antic disk subscribers can run VIEW3D.EXE without the ACTION! cartridge.

''When Paul submitted View 3-D to __Antic__, we saw it was easily the largest ACTION! program any magazine had considered publishing. But in recent months, we have received so many letters from readers wanting ACTION! that we thought it was time for a monster example of programming in this powerful Atari language.  
  
Be warned: there are ten separate program listings, nine of which are dependent on and INCLUDEd into the tenth to form one main program. Because of the nature of ACTION! there is no TYPO II, so type patiently and carefully The results will be well worth it.'' -ANTIC ED
