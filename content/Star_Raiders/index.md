![](attachments/Star_Raiders_box.jpg)  
  
The impossible has happened! Doug Neubauer, the author of the game, has given us the source code. Sadly, he didn't own an old listing anymore, but Steve Hales (Synapse) did! Kay Savetz has managed everything behind the scenes, so we would like to say:  
  
__Peta times thank you Doug Neubauer, Steve Hales and Kay Savetz!!!__  
  
We will be always in your debt and of course, you are always in our hearts! :-)))  
  
It was a little step for you, but at least a giant leap for the whole Atari community.  
  
The original Star Raiders source code can be found at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/AtariStarRaidersSourceCode) ; 2.47 GB  
  
If you would like to donate something to archive.org, please use the following [link](https://archive.org/donate/) ; the guys really deserve it!  
  
The Atari community has already started to bring the listing to files, please see at [github.com](https://github.com/XioNYC/StarRaiders)

- [Star_Raiders-needs_binary_load_program_from_cassette.cas](attachments/Star_Raiders-needs_binary_load_program_from_cassette.cas) ; cas version of Star Raiders, sold in the late 80's. Needs a [binary loader](../Boot_from_Cassette/index.md) to read in. Thank you so much FloppyDoc for creating the cas file. Stefan for creating the wav file and Mathy for the hardware to make the job possible. :-)
