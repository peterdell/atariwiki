This is an archive of the "Counseling Procedures" educational program published by Dorsett Educational Systems, Inc. in 1983. This was originally packaged as a set of 8 cassette tapes for use with Atari 400 and 800 computers and the Educational System Master Cartridge.  
  
The "raw recordings" directory contains the unaltered recordings from cassette, one file per tape, with both sides of each tape in the same file. You probably don't want to use this folder.  
  
The main files (co1 through co16) are likely the versions you want to use with your Atari or emulator. These have been split into 16 files (one per tape side). The audio levels have had their volume normalized, as well as any pops and clicks removed, and subsequently repaired on the data tracks. Each tape has been verified to work on the Altirra emulator.  
  
Finally, photos of the cassette tapes are included.  
  
The work of digitization and audio cleanup was done by Kay Savetz and Thomas Cherryhomes in May/June 2015.
