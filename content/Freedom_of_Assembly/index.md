## Abstract  
  
Many programmers have found the development and testing of  
assembly language subroutines easier within a Forth environment than  
using more conventional tools. Subroutines created this way can then  
be transformed to a form compatible with commercial assemblers,  
and linked to calling programs in mainstream languages. This article  
illustrates how to do this with three example subroutines of increasing  
complexity, using a popular public domain Forth running under MS  
Windows. The third example shows how to create tools not available  
with conventional assemblers.
