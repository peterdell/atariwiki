# Atari Wiki Manifesto  
  
This manifesto explains some ideas behind the AtariWiki.  
  
The AtariWiki is a collection of information about the Atari 8-Bit computer line mainly intended for programmers. It covers topics specific to the Atari 8-bit computers, but also generic programming topics like the 6502 line of processors, programming languages available for the Atari 8-bit machines, and generic programming tips and tricks.  
  
The main language in this wiki is English, however other languages are permitted with the goal to provide a translation into English at some point in time. Multi-language articles should use the "tab" feature to provide the same article content in different languages, with "English" as the default choice.  
  
One goal of this wiki is to provide a way to collect the pages and articles of this wiki into a book (either printed or eBook). The pages and articles should, therefore, be written similar to pages in a book.  
  
The wiki is a collection of information and knowledge. It should not contain temporary information that would be better served in a blog or discussion forum.  
  
Please do not zip or otherwise compress documents (PDF or DJVU). This Webserver does automatic "on-the-fly" gzip compression, and hard disk space is not an issue. Documents hidden in archives cannot be found by search engines and cannot be read on a mobile device.  
  
The AtariWiki is not an official project of the Atari Bit Byter User Club ([ABBUC](http://abbuc.de)) however, some contributors are associated with ABBUC.

The Wiki is operated by Carsten Strotmann (cas@strotmann.de).
