Bit 0 and Bit 1 control players and missiles. Players and missiles are visible only when the respective bit is set to 1. [SDMCTL](../SDMCTL/index.md) needs to be set accordingly also.  
  
"Latch Triggers" means that triggers of sticks and paddles stay in "pressed state" once pressed. To reset this, set Bit 2 to 0. This is valid for all triggers and cannot be set for single triggers only.
