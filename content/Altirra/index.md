Please un7z the file and put the app into the applications folder and don't alter the name. If Avery brings out a new version, just open the app-package (mouse right click on the app) and simply go to:  
  
/Applications/Altirra.app/Contents/Resources/wineprefix/drive_c/winebottler/  
  
and just replace  
  
Altirra.exe (for the 32 bit version) or Altirra64.exe (for the 64 bit version)  
  
with the new version from Avery. That's all. :-)  
  
Have fun.
