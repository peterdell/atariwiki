# ATARI TELELINK II Copyright (C) 1982 Atari, Inc.  
First we deeply thank Bill Lange for providing and scanning this ultra rare, extreme hard to find manual! Bill, we really can't thank you enough for your help in this case. In the name of the community: 'Thank you so much!'.  
  
The Atari Telelink II cartridge was sold in the USA only. It is a very special cartridge, because it has 2 flash memories for 2 telephone numbers. These numbers were stored inside the cartridge itself. Even after power off, the numbers were saved and could be retrieved on next power on. Please take into account that this was in 1982.
