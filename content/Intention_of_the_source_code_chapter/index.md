title: Intention of the source code chapter
---
# Source Code: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the AtariWiki. Its endless mission: to explore strange new programs, to seek out new levels and rooms, to boldly go where no user has gone before.  
# If you are an Atari author and remember the famous sentence from JFK: "...ask not what your country can do for you-ask what you can do for your country...", that question can be answered, but this time for the whole world! Please give the Atari community your source code, it is a little step for you, but a giant leap for all Atari users. It would be, as if the blind could see... ;-)  
  
# Thank you so much in advance for your support, we really appreciate that very much!!!  
# May God bless you and remember, the force will be with you, too, always! ;-)
