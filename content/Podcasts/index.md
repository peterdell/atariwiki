Vintage computer podcast about the Atari 8-bit line of personal computers.  
The Antic Podcast is an Atari 8-bit specific podcast with monthly shows covering news and regular interviews. The podcast team of Kay Savetz, Randy Kindig, and Brad Arnold have interviewed nearly all of the big players of the golden age of Atari.  The podcast is highly recommended! Missing it would be like having an Atari without a cartridge slot, to say it in one sentence. Just see for yourself:

Inverse ATASCII is a podcast which investigates the serious programs from Atari, apart from just the games. Yes, they exist! Wade Ripkowski shows once and for all, that the Atari is not just a 'game machine'. In each podcast he investigates one program. He digs the program as deep as the [Mariana Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench) compare to mother earth. At the end, there is no question left. Therefore, AtariWiki highly recommendeds his podcast:
