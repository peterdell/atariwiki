### Atari 1050 Alignment procedure  
  
- Switch on drive with no disk  
- shortcut TP7 and TP8  
- connect scope gnd to TP17  
- connect scope probe to TP 10, adjust C36 to 125 KHz  
- connect scope probe to TP 9, adjust VR3 to 250 ns pulse width  
- connect scope probe to TP 11, adjust VR5 to 1 us pulse width  
- remove shortcut between TP7 and TP8  
  
(I hope I didn't mix up TP9 and TP11 values, so please  
check for the smaller pulse width first and verify)
