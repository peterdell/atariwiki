# Turbo-BASIC XL by Frank Ostrowski 1985  
  
  
## Background  
Turbo-BASIC XL 1.5 is a fast [BASIC](../Basic/index.md) interpreter for the Atari XL and XE. Frank Ostrowski wrote it and first published it in the German Happy Computer magazine in 1985. TURBO is fully compatible with [Atari_BASIC](../Atari_BASIC/index.md) but fixes some well-known bugs and replaces its notoriously slow loops and math functions. The result is that Turbo-BASIC XL will run any Atari BASIC program but do so around three to five times as fast!  
  
If that is not enough, Turbo-BASIC XL also includes a suite of new keywords and functions to improve on the original. These include structured programming concepts like {{WHILE}} loops and similar, DOS commands that allow you to manipulate files without exiting to the DOS menu, {{DPOKE}} and {{DPEEK}} for working with 16-bit memory values, editing commands like {{RENUM}}, and debugging commands like {{TRACE}}. Yet, due to clever memory management, Turbo-BASIC XL leaves 1,700 more bytes of RAM free, allowing you to write larger programs than Atari BASIC.  
  
And if ''that'' wasn't enough, Ostrowski also released the Turbo-BASIC Compiler, which lets you take your completed programs and compile them so they run 15 to 20 times faster than Atari BASIC. The compiler has an associated runtime library, so the resulting programs run on machines without loading Turbo-BASIC XL.  
  
The original Turbo-BASIC XL ran only on the XL/XE machines, but Ostrowski later back-ported it to the original 400/800's as Frost BASIC 1.4, which was later named Turbo-BASIC 1.4. Other programmers have added their own extensions to the TURBO code, resulting in a profusion of minor versions.  
  
Turbo-BASIC XL is compatible with Atari BASIC, but it runs three to four times faster when interpreted and has advanced program control and I/O commands. Using the Turbo-BASIC XL compiler makes programs run 15-20 times faster than Atari BASIC, and it will compile Atari BASIC programs too!  
  
Turbo-BASIC XL will only work on XL and XE computers with at least 64K. Ostrowski is also the author of GFA BASIC for the Atari ST, which is being distributed in the U.S. by MichTron.  
  
TUREX.COM is the enhancement for Turbo-BASIC XL you are looking for. So, load Turbo-BASIC XL, then BLOAD or BRUN the TUREX.COM file. You now have an extended version of Turbo-BASIC XL with various new commands. Take a look at the TUREX.TXT file in the German documentation that shows all available extra commands...  
  
As mentioned before, all *.XTB files are only examples of the Turbo-BASIC XL enhancements. (The "Extended Turbo-BASIC XL" was originally released as an *.ARC file. I also put this file on the disk together with UNARC.COM; but you already find all unarced files on the disk, so the ARC file is redundant and just there for archiving purposes.)  
  
Afair, XTB had been created by Thorsten Karwoth. He is also the author of Atari Macro Assembler 4.32, Atari Macro Assembler XE 2.1, Power Packer, Packer and Linker, Megablast, MyDOS Batchfile Enhancement, Laser Duell, Soundmonitor Professional, and a few other programs. Thank you so much Thorsten, for giving your work into PD. We owe you very much. The community is deep in your debt!

## Source Code  
After years of investigation and paying government fees in 3-digit amounts, AtariWiki can disclose that the author of Turbo-BASIC XL, Frank Ostrowski, left us in 2011 at age 50 due to a severe disease. Deep investigations regarding his brother, sisters, colleagues, and so on conclude that the source code is lost. Even the enhanced version from Thorsten Karwoth is lost because of water damage in Thorsten's home, which destroyed all listings and diskettes. That is a very sad status, but there is still hope. If someone in the galaxy can build a source code out of this marvelous program from the original object code, as Lorenz did with Star Raiders [Star_Raiders_source_code_by_Lorenz_Wiest](../Star_Raiders_source_code_by_Lorenz_Wiest/index.md), we can rebuild it. We can build the best Basic for the Atari, faster, stronger, and better. We call the six million dollar Basic just simple Ultimate Basic. With all the source codes now in PD: [Source Codes](https://atariwiki.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Articles#section-Articles-ProgrammingLanguages), it should be possible. Stay tuned.  
  
Frank, wherever you are, you did a man's job - outstanding and far ahead of your time. Germany is deep in your debt, and so is the worldwide Atari community. We will never forget your work and your contribution to the world. You belong to those who are not replaceable and will never be forgotten. May god bless you wherever you are now.  
  
Well, sometimes miracles happen, so today: 5/22/17 ; Somewhere out there in the galaxy, a very good soul (who prefers to stay in the dark) with a great heart at the right place had the source code and we can offer it now with the permission of the Ostrowski family. Here we go:

TODO: (The following is not correct!) There is only a one-byte difference between the headers in the two files above, which is in the cartridge type definition section of the header. The Altirra CAR has the correct byte of "55" for a SIC cart, whereas the Atari800MacX CAR has "30", which is the type defined for a MegaCart 256 KB. Thank you MrFish from AtariAge for your help! :-)
