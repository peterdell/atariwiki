# MAC/65 Macro Assembler; Copyright Stephen D. Lawrow; OSS, Inc.; ICD, Inc. & FTe  
  
MAC/65 is a 6502 macro assembler written by Stephen D. Lawrow and originally sold by [Optimized Systems Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimized_Systems_Software) for the Atari 8-bit computers. It was first released on disk in 1982, then later on a 16 KiB bank-switched 'SuperCartridge'.  
  
MAC/65 along with other OSS products became part of ICD's catalogue of Atari products in January 1988. In 1994, Fine Tooned Engineering obtained limited rights to ICD's 8-bit products, including MAC/65.  
  
  
# Disk versions  
  
%%(float:right)![](attachments/MAC65-Disk.jpg)%%  
  
MAC/65 was initially developed as a disk-based program. It replaced an earlier assembler, [EASMD](../EASMD/index.md), in OSS's product portfolio. The first version, 2.00, was released in 1982.  
  
The MAC/65 disk also included a debugger, [BUG/65](../BUG65/index.md), developed by McStuff Company. The disk also contained a DOS; initially it was [OS/A+](../OSS_OS-A_/index.md), later replaced with [DOS XL](../OSS_DOS_XL/index.md).  
  
## MAC/65 2.00 (1982)  
  
This is the first disk version, released in 1982.

## MAC/65 4.20 - FTe re-release (1994)  
  
After Fine Tooned Engineering obtained rights to MAC/65 from ICD, they re-released version 4.20 in 1994, as shareware to be used exclusively with the [PC_Xformer](../PC_Xformer/index.md) emulator. The disk contained additional documentation files and the program had modified copyright text, but was otherwise identical.

## Patches from OSS Newsletter  
  
MAC/65 4.20 was not without bugs. OSS published a few patches for it in their Summer 1983 newsletter:  
  
%%(float:left)![](attachments/MAC-65-patches-Summer-1983-1.jpg)%%  
%%(float:left)![](attachments/MAC-65-patches-Summer-1983-2.jpg)%%  
  
# Cartridge versions  
  
After version 4.20, Lawrow rewrote MAC/65 for cartridge medium. It utilized OSS's own "SuperCartridge" - a 16 KB bankswitched cartridge that occupied only 8 KB of Atari memory, and could be disabled or enabled at will. It provided much more comfortable experience than the disk version. MAC/65 cartridges were produced using both two-chip and one-chip variants of the SuperCartridge.  
  
The cartridge version replaced BUG/65 with another debugger - [DDT](../DDT/index.md) (Dunion's Debugging Tool) developed by James J. Dunion.

%%(float:right)![](attachments/Cart.jpg)  
![](attachments/Mac-65+orange+1.jpg)

### Source code  
In 2017 AtariAge user Alfred published source code for MAC/65 1.01 that he had obtained from ICD back in the day.[2](../2/index.md) Dated 1988, the sources are in the format of Mike Gustafson's cross-assembler that was used internally at ICD. When ICD bought the rights to OSS portfolio, they apparently converted the sources from their original MAC/65 syntax to ICD's cross-assembler.

# MAC/65 ToolKit  
  
OSS offered a companion disk to MAC/65. MAC/65 ToolKit was sold either separately or in bundle with MAC/65, and contained a collection of helpful macros and routines implementing various common operations. The ToolKit supported both disk and cartridge versions of MAC/65.

# Later work-in-progress versions  
Although version 1.02 was the last one published commercially, Stephen Lawrow continued development of MAC/65 - he kept fixing bugs and adding new features, all ultimately unpublished.  
  
In 2016, the AtariWiki team received a set of microfilms from an anonymous source,[3](../3/index.md)[4](../4/index.md) that contained hex printouts of source listings of 3 different versions of MAC/65. Through the painstaking process of digitizing the microfilms, the team managed to recover the original files, and combined them into ATR images provided below.  
  
Note: while source files and binary images in the provided ATR images were restored from microfilms, the other contents of the disk images - e.g. DOS files - were added by the AtariWiki team for convenience.[5](../5/index.md)  
  
## MAC/65 1.01 (1986)  
  
### Source code  
- MAC/65 1.01 (1986) source code (See [A call for help](../Mac65ACallForHelp/index.md) below):  
** [Disk 1 (master)](attachments/mac-xl-master-icd.atr)  
** [Disk 2 (slave)](attachments/mac-xl-slave-icd.atr)  
  
This version, despite identifying itself as MAC/65 1.01 on the title screen, is actually a later development; comments in the master source file (NEWMAIN) identify this version interchangeably as "MAC XE" and "MAC XL", with the copyright year of 1986. This version is different than the commercially-released v. 1.01 (or any released version, actually), although the actual functional differences are yet to be investigated.  
  
The sources are in MAC/65 format; they may be built using MAC/65 1.02. Two disk drives are needed. The master diskette should be placed in the D1: disk drive, and the slave diskette in D2:. The master source file is D2:NEWMAIN. Change RAM to 0 and EPROM to 1 in D2:NEWMAIN (lines 190-200) and then assemble from RAM to disk, by entering:  
  
{{LOAD #D2:NEWMAIN  
ASM ,,#D2:NEWMAIN.OBJ}}  
  
The resulting file NEWMAIN.OBJ is a binary DOS file that loads itself into the $3000-$6fff area; these are the 16 KB ROM data for the two-chip variant of the OSS SuperCartridge. To build a ROM image for the one-chip variant, additionally change BANK2 to $D509 and BANK3 to $D501 in D1:EQUATE.INC (lines 180-190).  
  
### Cartridge images  
Here are cartridge images created by building the sources.

## MAC XE 3.4i (1986-02-11)  
  
The "slave" source disk of MAC/65 v. 3.6 (described in a [later section](../Mac65MAC653.619880107/index.md)) contains a file named MACXE.EPR, which is an assembled binary of a version of MAC/65 that identifies itself as "MAC XE version 3.4i" with the date 2/11/86.  
  
![](attachments/MAC_XE_3.4i.jpg)  
  
This version is identical to the "Assembler v. 3.4" version (described in the [next section](../Mac65Assembler3.419871221/index.md)), the only difference being the text on the start screen. To build a version that is identical to MACXE.EPR, take the sources of Assembler 3.4 and change the lines 40-70 of D1:COPY:  
  
{{40 MES   .BYTE $7D,"MAC XE",TAB,TAB  
50       .CBYTE "Version 3.4i"  
60 MES1  .BYTE "(c) 1985 Stephen D. Lawrow"  
70       .CBYTE "   2/11/86 ",TAB}}  
  
### Cartridge images  
The following cartridge images were created by building the Assembler 3.4 sources after modifying them as described above.

## Assembler 3.4 (1987-12-21)  
  
### Source code  
- Assembler 3.4 source code (See [A call for help](../Mac65ACallForHelp/index.md) below):  
** [Disk 1 (master)](attachments/mac-xl-1.atr)  
** [Disk 2(slave)](attachments/mac-xl-2.atr)  
  
This version of MAC/65 presents itself on the title screen as "Assembler version 3.4" with date "12/21/87". It is currently unknown what are the functional differences between this version and the other ones.  
  
The sources are in MAC/65 format; they may be built using MAC/65 1.02. Two disk drives are needed. The master diskette should be placed in the D1: disk drive, and the slave diskette in D2:. The master source file is D1:MASTER. Change RAM to 0 and EPROM to 1 in D1:MASTER (lines 190-200) and then assemble from RAM to disk, by entering:  
  
{{LOAD #D1:MASTER  
ASM ,,#D1:MASTER.OBJ}}  
  
The resulting file MASTER.OBJ is a binary DOS file that loads itself into the $3000-$6fff area; these are the 16 KB ROM data for the two-chip variant of the OSS SuperCartridge. To build a ROM image for the one-chip variant, additionally change BANK2 to $D509 and BANK3 to $D501 in D1:EQUATE.INC (lines 180-190).  
  
As noted in the [previous section](../Mac65MACXE3.4i19860211/index.md), the resulting file MASTER.OBJ differs from the MAC XL 3.4i binary (found on the MAC/65 v. 3.6 source disks) only in the copyright text.

### Source code  
- MAC/65 3.6. source code (See [A call for help](../Mac65ACallForHelp/index.md) below):  
** [Disk 1 (master)](attachments/mac-xl-master-3.6-1988.atr)  
** [Disk 2 (slave)](attachments/mac-xl-slave-3.6-1988.atr)  
  
This version of MAC/65 presents itself on the title screen as "MAC/65 version 3.6" with date "01/07/88". Judging from the dates in the source code, this is chronologically the last known version of MAC/65. It is currently unknown what are the functional differences between this version and the other ones.  
  
![](attachments/MAC-65_3.6.jpg)  
  
The "slave" source disk also contains a file named MACXE.EPR, which is an assembled binary of MAC XE 3.4i (described in an [earlier section](../Mac65MACXE3.4i19860211/index.md)).  
  
The sources are in MAC/65 format; they may be built using MAC/65 1.02. Two disk drives are needed. The master diskette should be placed in the D1: disk drive, and the slave diskette in D2:. The master source file is D1:MASTER. Change RAM to 0 and EPROM to 1 in D1:MASTER (lines 190-200) and then assemble from RAM to disk, by entering:  
  
{{LOAD #D1:MASTER  
ASM ,,#D1:MASTER.OBJ}}  
  
The resulting file MASTER.OBJ is a binary DOS file that loads itself into the $3000-$6fff area; these are the 16 KB ROM data for the two-chip variant of the OSS SuperCartridge. To build a ROM image for the one-chip variant, additionally change BANK2 to $D509 and BANK3 to $D501 in D1:EQUATE.INC (lines 180-190).

# A call for help  
  
The source files of the work-in-progress versions of MAC/65 have not yet been analysed. It is unknown what are the new features introduced in each of the following versions:  
  
- [MAC/65 1.01 (1986)](../Mac65MAC651.011986/index.md)  
- [Assembler 3.4](../Mac65Assembler3.41987-12-21/index.md)  
- [MAC/65 3.6](../Mac65MAC653.61988-01-07/index.md)  
  
Comparing source codes of these versions to each other, and to the [source code of the released version 1.01](../Mac65SourceCode/index.md), would allow to discover the new features and document them. Yotta-thanks to all who help us here.
