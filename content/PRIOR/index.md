PF0-PF3 Playfield colors [COLOR0](../COLOR0/index.md).../[COLPF0](../COLPF0/index.md)...  
BAK background or border color [COLOR4](../COLOR4/index.md)/[COLBK](../COLBK/index.md)  
  
A logical OR is done to the colors of players 0/1 and 2/3 when they overlap. Only the 0/1, 2/3 combinations are allowed; you will not get a third color when players 1 and 3 overlap, the priorities set with bits 0â€¦3 are applied.  
  
If put together into a 5th player (set Bit 4 to '1') the missiles get the color of register 3 [COLOR3](../COLOR3/index.md). They still move independently, e.g. set their horizontal positions with [HPOSM0](../HPOSM0/index.md) - [HPOSM3](../HPOSM3/index.md)  
  
## GTIA Modes  
This register can be used to select one of GTIA GRAPHICS modes 9, 10 and 11.  
||GTIA Mode*||Bit 6||Bit 7||Description  
|9|0|1|16 different luminances of the same hue (color)  
|10|1|0|9 different colors  
|11|1|1|16 different hues (colors) of the same luminance  
* the same as GRAPHICS x in BASIC
