# How to setup an ACTION! Development Disk  
  
Each Programmer has its own ideas how a development environment should look like. On this page you can find some ideas. If you are an ACTION! programmer feel free to add your favorite setup to this page:  
  
## ACTION! Setup  
  
1. Normally I use a blank disk for each new project (serious projects, not quick and dirty tests).  I use an ACTION! Cart that can be switched on/off without removing the cart. The disk will be formatted in Single Density or Medium Density Dos 2.x Format (because if I take the disks to a convention there is sometimes no upgraded DD Floppy Drive available).  
1. Next I copy a dos, mostly Stefan Dorndorfs DOS II+ or XDOS. If I write a PGM for MyDos or Sparta/Bewe, I use that DOS.  
1. then I copy the essential tools  
1. the Runtime Source --> [Original_ACTION!_System_Runtime_Source](../Original_ACTION!_System_Runtime_Source/index.md) and [Alternative_ACTION_Runtime_Source](../Alternative_ACTION_Runtime_Source/index.md)  
1. the [Infoline](../Infoline/index.md) Tool which gives two additional Screenlines with Information on the ACTION! System  
1. some of the Library Routines I need from --> [Action](../Action/index.md)  
  
That's all. Nothing special here :)
